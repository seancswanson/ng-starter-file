# NgStarterFile

## What is this?

This is a boilerplate for single-page applications intended for more efficient development with some styling choices that I prefer. 

This project is meant to be cloned and tweaked for applications so its expected that this will *not* have absolutely everything but it sets up the files in a way that make expanding it straightforward.

Features include:
- Responsive CSS Grid layout with:
  -  a header (menu button, app name, search bar, profile icon)
  -  expandable sidebar that flexes the main content area to its left
- Sidebar items to seed navigation to other routes
- Routing set up with some stub pages for plug and play development
- Sidebar nav responds to active route
- CSS Normalizer imported globally
- SCSS partials for colors
- Assets folder with common icons


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
